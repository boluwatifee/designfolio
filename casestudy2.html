                <span class="text">Based on the market analysis i carried out, <br>
                    The online travel booking industry was among those hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic, 
                    with some apps reporting more than 70% less traffic and bookings in 2019 than in 2018.
                    <br> The situation improved slightly in 2021, though most apps and agencies 
                    still reported lower numbers than in 2019. In some countries, outbreaks continue to impede travel.
                    International tourism has recovered since January 2022, 
                    compared to the weak start in the last year: Europe (+199%) and the Americas (+97%). 
                    The Middle East (+89%) and Africa (+51%) experienced a travel business growth in Jan 2022 compared to 2021. 
                    While Asia and the Pacific saw a 44% increase in business growth, 
                    some destinations went through the decrease in international arrivals in 2019. 
                    After the tourism growth of 2022 and 2021, international arrivals will continue to recover by 2022. In March 2022, 
                    12 places had no covid-19 pandemic restrictions and witnessed a rise of tourist attractions eliminating the restriction. 
                    It helps to unleash pent-up demand for travel and tourism.(Adamosoft, business of apps,2022) <br> 
                    Travel apps are used by travelers for online ticketing, hotel booking, 
                    destination details, locating local attractions and food outlets, exploring new destinations, 
                    finding reviews about a destination they plan to visit, sharing pictures from their trip, 
                    and providing feedback on a destination, airline, hotel, or event.

                <p class="subtitle">While working on this project, I learned more about User Centered Design as I interviewed target users, 
                    I got to understand and empathize with them then ensured that their noted pain points were at the front of my mind while designing.
                    Both the secondary and primary research helped shape my thinking and influenced my design decision process.</p>

                    <li><b>Worrying less about details.</b> I was initially overly focused on the UI but I quickly realized there is no great product 
                        without a properly structured UX.</li>
                    <li><b>It is important to keep the users’ pain points front and center.</b> This helped to shape my thinking, and made me more 
                        focused on solving the problem. I asked myself questions like:  How do I want my users to feel? How can I make their lives easier?</li>
                    <li><b>Based on usability testing</b>, some users did not want to have to google every location; instead, they wanted to be 
                        able to get adequte information about different places right from the app, which the app provides. 
                        Some others wanted an easier way to keep track of travel deals without constantly checking the app.</li>
