            <div class="content">
                <p class="subtitle">While working on this project, I learned more about User Centered Design as I interviewed target users, 
                    I got to understand and empathize with them then ensured that their noted pain points were at the front of my mind while designing.
                    Both the secondary and primary research helped shape my thinking and influenced my design decision process.</p>
                <span class="text">
                    <li><b>Worrying less about details.</b> I was initially overly focused on the UI but I quickly realized there is no great product 
                        without a properly structured UX.</li>
                    <li><b>It is important to keep the users’ pain points front and center.</b> This helped to shape my thinking, and made me more 
                        focused on solving the problem. I asked myself questions like:  How do I want my users to feel? How can I make their lives easier?</li>
                    <li><b>Based on usability testing</b>, some users did not want to have to google every location; instead, they wanted to be 
                        able to get adequte information about different places right from the app, which the app provides. 
                        Some others wanted an easier way to keep track of travel deals without constantly checking the app.</li>
