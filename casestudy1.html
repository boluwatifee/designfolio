                <p class="subtitle">People want to work out from home more</p>
                <span class="text">Everyone had to stay at home when COVID-19 struck. The gym junkies, 
                    those who just liked the idea of staying fit but were too lazy 
                    to do so, in short, everyone. <br> With little to nothing to do, most people had to 
                    start home workouts to stay healthy. <br> I personally like the idea of staying fit 
                    and working out from home, so I downloaded various apps to follow a fitness schedule, 
                    but it was always difficult for me to stay consistent because I either didn't see 
                    the desired difference while using one app or the user experience of the app was 
                    simply not encouraging. <br> So I wondered, how would we cope if we were all forced to 
                    stay at home again? Do I have to wait until I return home to work out if I go on vacation? 
                    How can working out from home be made to have the same effect as working out in a gym?
                    <br> All these thoughts made me carry out an interview to find out if this was an actual problem other people faced.
